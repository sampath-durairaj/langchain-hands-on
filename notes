Three ways to build a chatbot

Pure LCEL (Langchain Expression Language)
RunnableWithMessageHistory
Langraph

Memory:

It hold previous conversation and return response if it's similar context

Drawbacks:
    No session maintenance. 


Memory optimization techniques
1. Sliding window - last n messages
2. Summarized memory
3. Limit based on tokens


Sequential Chain and Conditional routing

Simple chain
Sequencial chain -> combined. output of one chain is input for another chain
Whn we can use  :if big problem can split into multiple chain and merge the result
this contain all intermediate output

Conditional routing
same as If else
need to put in chain
chain run based on the conditional
